#  Clothing Segmentation & Color Recognition (YOLO + SAM)

This repository contains **Phase 1** of a larger Virtual Wardrobe & Outfit Recommendation project.  
The goal of this phase is to:

- Detect people and clothing regions in images
- Segment garments using Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM)
- Extract dominant clothing colors from segmented regions
- Visualize segmentation masks and color swatches

This module forms the **foundation for garment understanding** in the Virtual Wardrobe pipeline.
